I am using <a href=\"https://audible-converter.ml/\">Audible Tools</a> to help me create the ffmpeg command to do this.</p>\n<p>Another recent discovery is that <a href=\"https://overcast.fm/\">Overcast</a>, my podcast player of choice, seems to natively support .m4b files (audiobook file format). It even includes artwork and chapters, so it behaves just like most of the podcasts I listen to.</p>\n",
